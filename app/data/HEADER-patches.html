<h1>Ubuntu's Debian patches repository</h1>
<p>
These patches are generated daily and contain the differences between an
Ubuntu source package and the equivalent version of the same source in
Debian.  This means that the base of the patch for an Ubuntu
<tt>1.2-3ubuntu4</tt> version will be the Debian <tt>1.2-3</tt> package,
even if the Debian version is now <tt>1.4-1</tt>.  This hopefully makes
the packages easier to merge.
</p>
<p>
Where Ubuntu have packaged a new upstream themselves, noted by a revision
beginning <tt>0ubuntu</tt> the patch is from the first Debian revision of
the same upstream version if available (so <tt>1.2-0ubuntu1</tt> will be
compared from the Debian <tt>1.2-1</tt> package).  Where not available, you
will usually find that the base of the patch is the first common ancestor of
both Ubuntu and Debian.
</p>
<p>
The layout is the same as a Debian FTP pool, so to see the changes made to
<tt>debhelper</tt> see the <tt><a href="d/debhelper">d/debhelper</a></tt>
directory and to see the changes made to <tt>libraw1394</tt> see the
<tt><a href="libr/libraw1394">libr/libraw1394</a></tt> directory.  The
filename within that directory indicates the current version of the source
in Ubuntu.
</p>
<p>
A machine-parseable index of the patch set is available in the
<tt><a href="PATCHES">PATCHES</a></tt> file.  The format of this file is
one source package per line, with the name of the source package and relative
path to the current patch file separated by a space on each line.
</p>
