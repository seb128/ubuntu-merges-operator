<h1>Ubuntu Merge-o-Matic</h1>
<p>
These directories contain the result of the Ubuntu automated merge system,
fondly known as the Merge-o-Matic or just "mom".  Merges are generated by
combining both the Ubuntu and Debian changes since their first common
ancestor and leaving any conflicts to be resolved by human hand.
</p>
<p>
The layout is the same as a Debian FTP pool, so to see the merge for
<tt>debhelper</tt> see the <tt><a href="d/debhelper">d/debhelper</a></tt>
directory and to see the merge for <tt>libraw1394</tt> see the
<tt><a href="libr/libraw1394">libr/libraw1394</a></tt> directory.  In
each directory you will find a <tt>REPORT</tt> file that tells you what
the files mean and what to do.
</p>
<p>
To grab all the relevant files for a merge, a
<tt><a href="grab-merge.sh">grab-merge.sh</a></tt> script is available.  Be
sure to run it from a scratch directory as any other contents will be lost.
</p>
<p>
Status pages showing the outstanding merges for each component are available,
choose <a href="main.html">main</a>, <a href="restricted.html">restricted</a>,
<a href="universe.html">universe</a> or
<a href="multiverse.html">multiverse</a>.
</p>
<p>
For some merges, Merge-o-Matic cannot determine the base version for the
merge, and you have to perform the merge by hand.  These are listed for
<a href="main-manual.html">main</a>,
<a href="restricted-manual.html">restricted</a>,
<a href="universe-manual.html">universe</a> and
<a href="multiverse-manual.html">multiverse</a>.
</p>
